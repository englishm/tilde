<h1>Screening ASCII Star Wars</h1>

<p><i>NB: This is not very (read: not) secure. As always, please don't hack the Gibson.</i></p>

<p>As the host:</p>
<pre>
tmux -S /tmp/starwars new -s starwars
chmod 777 /tmp/starwars
</pre>

<p>Then wall to let people know it's ready and they can join with:</p>
<pre>
tmux -S /tmp/starwars attach -t starwars
</pre>

<p>Once people have joined, start the film:</p>
<pre>
telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl
</pre>

<p>Enjoy! (It ends pretty early, so don't be disappointed.)</p>

<h3>Cleanup</h3>
<p>You can clean up afterwards by removing the shared socket:<p>
<pre>rm /tmp/starwars</pre>
